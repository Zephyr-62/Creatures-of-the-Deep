  description: 'Please take a look around the submarine before we begin.

    You
    might have noticed that two arrows appear around your reticle when you hover
    over certain objects. This means that you can grab onto the object by pressing
    the left mouse button.

    Grab and play with the objects if you like, but be
    sure to move them back to their starting positions after!<br>

    Please press
    the confirm button to continue.'
