  description: 'The remaining controls in the cabin are how you can fix any malfunctions
    that might occur. In this test these can only occur through collisions. We plan
    to have instructions on how to fix these in an in-game manual, but for now there''s
    only the indicator lights to signal what''s wrong. You''re welcome to try and
    solve the malfunctions but don''t be afraid to just reset<br>

    Please press
    the confirm button to continue.'
