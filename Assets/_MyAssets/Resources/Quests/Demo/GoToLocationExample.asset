  description: 'The first location is right ahead. It has been marked on the sonar.<br>

    Begin
    by starting the engine. At the back of the cabin you''ll find an engine power
    and ignition switch. After switching both of these you can pull the pulley above
    to start the engine. Be sure to pull hard since the engine is pretty crap.


    Please
    confirm when you have arrived.'
