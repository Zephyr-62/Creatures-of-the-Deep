  description: 'Hello,

    

    Thank you for finding all the artifacts.

    Unfortunately,
    the cost of recovering the submarine exceeds our current budget for this expedition.

    To
    ensure that this matter does not negatively affect the reputation of our company,
    we must terminate our cooperation immediately.

    We wish you continued success.

    

    Best
    wishes,

    Baro Automatica'
